Spring main class steps:
    1. Define/Read the Spring config file = (container) = (context)
    2. Retrieve the bean(s) from Spring container
    3. Call method(s) on the bean
    4. Close the context


Bean Scopes refer to lifecycle of a bean:
 - How long the bean lives
 - How many instances are created
 - How is the bean shared

Default Scope of Spring bean is SINGLETON (shared reference to the same bean)
                                PROTOTYPE (different references to different beans)

Bean Lifecycle
  - Add any method to the bean class
  - Annotate those with @PostConstruct
                        @PreDestroy


Spring Annotations
    -> @Component     - To find Spring within the component scan package that which classes are beans
                        Can also provide explicit bean id @Component("theBean")

    -> @Autowired     - To let Spring find the bean implementation(s) of FortuneService
                        Selects the appropriate candidate with the help of @Qualifier
                        Creates the bean and automatically injects at (Contructor, Setter, Method, Field)
    -> @Configuration - To let Spring know that this is a Java Configuration class.
                        It eliminates xml config file altogether.
    -> @ComponentScan - Tells Spring to look for all beans inside the package
                        @ComponentScan("com.gemalto.archit")
    -> @Scope         - Defines bean scope (Default:Singleton)
    -> @PostConstruct - Bean lifecycle
    -> @PreDestroy    - Bean lifecycle
