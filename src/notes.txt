Spring main class steps:
    1. Define/Read the Spring config file = (container) = (context)
    2. Retrieve the bean(s) from Spring container
    3. Call method(s) on the bean
    4. Close the context


Bean Scopes refer to lifecycle of a bean:
 - How long the bean lives
 - How many instances are created
 - How is the bean shared

Default Scope of Spring bean is SINGLETON (shared reference to the same bean)
                                PROTOTYPE (different references to different beans)
